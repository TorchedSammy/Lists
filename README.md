# Lists
> Lists of things!

Very simple. This repo lists a bunch of stuff! Surprising. Listed content will include things relating to games, programming, music.  
To get started, dive into the [Lists](Lists/) directory. Then you will find folders grouping lists into categories.  
These other folders/categories may or may not have other subdirectories.  

You are free to contribute any list (discuss via GitHub Discussions first)!
